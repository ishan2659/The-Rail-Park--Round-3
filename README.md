# The-Rail-Park--Round-3


I did tried my best to make the webpage look as close as it can to the original webpage, here's a summary:-

1) I made a sticky header with a translucent bg which gets hidden when we scroll down on the webpage and comes back upon scrolling back up or reloading the page.

2) I created a Parallax animation on the logic of scroll value or the distance of a certain element's topside and the top of viewport, this parallax animation is applied on carousel and certain image-video sections such as the viaduct and the cut.

3) I created a hamburger menu which overlaps as soon as it gets toggled by adding a show class.

4) I also tried my best to replicate the carousel animation of the original webpage using the translate(x,y) property in css and asserting control over it by js.

5) I also tried to replicate the text visible animation in which as a certain element gets visible at some percentage of its height the animation gets triggered and a show class is added to it making it visible smoothly.

6) I have also added hover effects throughout the website such as a smooth hovering effect when we hover the sections of viaduct and cut which triggers a video.

7) Added a email validation using a regex pattern.

8) Added an infinite rotating animation on footer on the donate now svg.

9) The whole website is responsive for all screen sizes with multiple media queries spanning the entire screen size from 1400px to 300px.
